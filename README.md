## Web Scraping & Data Extraction with Python

A showcase of two real-world data scraping projects using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. These projects demonstrate my ability to automate data extraction from both simple and complex websites.

### Tools Used
Python, 
Selenium, 
BeautifulSoup, 
Pandas, 
(CSV / Excel / JSON)

### Project 1: Job Data Extraction from Wuzzuf

- Extracted job postings including titles, companies, locations, and post dates  
- Handled dynamic content loading with Selenium  
- Structured the data into a clean CSV format for analysis or reporting  
- Built reusable scripts for daily or scheduled scraping  

### Project 2: Product Data Extraction from Amazon

- Scraped product titles, prices, ratings, and availability  
- Bypassed basic anti-scraping measures using `undetected_chromedriver`  
- Exported results to well-formatted CSV files  
- Focused on accurate extraction despite JavaScript-heavy pages  

### Output

Final file with all data in an organized and simple way in Csv, Excel, Json format
> These projects reflect my ability to automate web scraping workflows and deliver structured, usable datasets that can fuel decision-making, research, or business intelligence.
